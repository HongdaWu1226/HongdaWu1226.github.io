<!-- ## **Research Interests:** -->

I have been very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ping Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3sIHxrcAAAAJ&hl=en), and to be able to collaborate with Prof. [Danijela Cabric](https://cores.ee.ucla.edu/people/danijela-cabric/) in a research camp. 

## **Research Interests:**
My research interests are in machine learning, optimization, and distributed systems. I specified federated and on-device learning, distributed optimization, and their application to data analytics, IoT systems, and future intelligent wireless networks. I am also highly interested in concepts including LLM, GenAI and the nexus between those techniques and federated learning for task-specific applications

<!-- I am highly interested in a wide range of research topics related to federated learning, including _data heterogeneity, quantization, personalization, incentive design, and byzantine resilience_, some of which have been explored during my Ph.D. study, and I am eager to learn more on those topics.<br />-->

<!--(_If you have any question regarding my research, or would like to collaborate on a relevant topic of interest and learn together, feel free to drop an email._ <br /> ) -->
Check the [CV](../files/CV_HongdaWu.pdf) for more details.
