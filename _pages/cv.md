<!-- ## **Research Interests:** -->

I have been very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ping Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3sIHxrcAAAAJ&hl=en), and to be able to collaborate with Prof. [Danijela Cabric](https://cores.ee.ucla.edu/people/danijela-cabric/) in a research camp. 

I am highly interested in a wide range of research topics related to federated learning, including _data heterogeneity, quantization, personalization, incentive design, and byzantine resilience_, some of which have been explored during my Ph.D. study, and I am eager to learn more on those topics.<br />
