_I am on the job market looking for **Research Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer** position_.

I obtained the Ph.D. in Dec. 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Ping Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3sIHxrcAAAAJ&hl=en), in the Dept. EECS, York University, Canada. The thesis is about handling federated learning challenges in heterogeneous networks.

I have finished two industrial internships during my Ph.D., where I worked as a research engineer in Sony R&D, Tokyo, and an associate researcher in Noah Ark's Lab, Montreal Research Centre, Montreal, focusing on applying federated learning to auto-driving systems (applicable), and personalization use-case (theoretical), respectively.

My research interests are in machine learning, optimization, and distributed systems. Specifically, I am interested in 
* Designing theoretical frameworks for distributed/federated learning (FL) systems
* Leveraging foundation model for privacy-preserving ML use cases (e.g., with transferability)
* Integrating GenAI with FL systems for better robustness and adaptability (e.g., personalization)

  

<!--  I obtained M.A.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering from Communication University of China, Beijing, where I focused on physical layer problems of wireless communication. -->
