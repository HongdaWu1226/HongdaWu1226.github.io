<!-- A few facts about me: -->
* I enjoy very much spending my non-working life on a wide range of sports<br/> (badminton, tennis, 10km running, cycling, surfing)

    <!-- + Music (e.g., Jacky Chueng, Westlife, Ed Sheeran) -->
* I started watching NBA since I was 7 years old. Now the idol is Kevin Durant <br/> (though the enthusiasm is dropping))

* I also like music, movies, cooking, reading history and science \& tech books
<!-- * I was enjoyable to live with Judy (a small garfield) for several month -->
* I am a tireless traveler and a travel photographer (I am fascinated with the smetropolis and skyscrapers)
